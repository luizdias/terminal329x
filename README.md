**Inspiration**
Our inspiration was to made a game that is different from what we see in the market, we tried to create a immersive story where the player actions change the flow and also how the game ends.

**What it does**
It's a game that simulates an old terminal, where someone starts to communicate with you, and you don't who it is and what is happening.

**How we built it**
We used Unity and native iOS/Swift to create the game, we made that as a challenge and to prove our knowledge and that our game concept are not limited by platform.

**Challenges we ran into**
Our biggest challenge was with sure the time. But we had another challenges, like how to make the story file to be read and interpreted by 2 different programming languages, and how to solve each of them.

**Accomplishments that we're proud of**
We are very proud of the final product of the Vanhackathon. It's not polished yet, but it's alive. In such a short time frame we were able to discuss the ideas, choose the best one, create a main story, make the mockups, the UI/UX Design and develop the game. We also made a video to show you a little about us.

**What we learned**
We learned a lot, like the challenges when you are building a game in so short deadline. We have expertise in develop and deliver apps in the company we work, but a game was a new area for us. We could learn a lot about game design, about how to write a story, how to look for ways to make your idea true, and maybe it became a success.

**What's next for 329x Terminal**
The next step? Well, we wanna polish the game, improve the story, giving more play time to the players. And if you guys want, why can't do that as an A Thinking Ape employee?

We hope you enjoy the game, enjoy our work.

Best Regards.
